WublinStatueBio=This Wublin statue has been carefully crafted by its mysterious maker, down to the finest detail. Now all that's missing is the spark of life! Zap the monsters you've bred or placed on this island, and they'll transform into the electrical energy required to take up this Wublin.

DipsterBio=Timid in the light, Dipsters make their homes underground. The muffled monster music from above gives Dipsters the courage to rise and join the harmonious melody! ... although it may only be one note at a time. Dipsters are resourceful creatures, and collect natural materials to disguise the entrances to their tunnels. No one knows how far down a Dipster hole goes.

MonsterLockedBio=You haven't found this monster yet. Play the game and unlock it later.

Monsters/Monster_wubbox=Wubbox
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_young_new=Young Wubbox
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_young_new_bio=One day as the Monsters were tunneling underground, they stumbled upon an immense vault containing several of the mysterious objects known as the Wubbox. Very little is known of their origin or purpose, save a few observations: after being incubated in the Nursery, sample analysis of the box's exterior indicates that it shares traits with every known Natural Monster species - in fact, it even has specialized compartments with an otherworldly shrinking technology. The box is also imbued with an elemental energy unfamiliar to those on the surface - a shocking discovery, to say the least. Gather some intrepid Monster volunteers and see what happens when you 'zap' them!
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_young_new_awake_bio=Eureka! The Wubbox awakes! As it turns out, this extraordinary Electric Elemental is vital to the life processes of the Colossal island spirits that the other singing denizens call home. The shrunken Monsters used to power up the creature report that the inside is as fun as any Playground they've ever seen, so they are happy to stay indefinitely. The robotic chirps and whistles it uses to express itself can take some getting used to, but eventually become a beloved and inextricable part of the island's tune. Besides, it's all the rage in 'current' music.

Monsters/Monster_jeeode_young=Young Jeeode
Monsters/Monster_jeeode_young_bio=The wise Jeeode is renowned for its ability to see all sides of a situation. Harnessing the Ethereal power of Crystal, it pictures each scenario as sitting in the center of a giant prism, looking at each facet one at a time. Then, it somehow creates a solution that leaves everyone smiling. Because of this refined perspective, Jeeodes are first-rate instrumentalists, never missing a note.

Monsters/Monster_potbelly_young=Young Potbelly
Monsters/Monster_potbelly_young_bio=Playing is so much better with 2 heads! The young potbelly is a welcome addition to any strategy game, on account of their doubled brainpower. Unfortunately for the other monsterlings, Two times Zero is still Zero. 
Monsters/Monster_mammott_young=Young Mammott
Monsters/Monster_mammott_young_bio=The abominamble snowman? More like the adorable snowmons! Mammott isnt quite a boistrous master of "Bom"s but we're getting there. Meanwhile, Mammott prefers to eat food and fluff its fur. Typical. 
Monsters/Monster_tweedle_young=Young Tweedle
Monsters/Monster_tweedle_young_bio=Lalalalaaaaa :( lalaaaaaaa D;
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_young=Young Toe Jammer
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_young_bio=Effervescent and bubbly, tropical-demeanored Young Toe Jammers are always pleasant playmates for the other monsters. At times, situations can get a little sticky when a tossed ball finds itself lodged in the gelatinous body of this tot, but that's no match for some well executed laughter therapy.
Monsters/Monster_noggin_young=Young Noggin
Monsters/Monster_noggin_young_bio=Thump thump Bump bump! The newborn noggin's hands aren't quite steady enough to provide that rhythm it's known for, but that doesnt stop it from trying. Juvenile Noggins sometimes let their musical mishaps get out of hand, often trying to bounce with the Thumpies, with very limited success. 
Monsters/Monster_kayna_young=Young Kayna
Monsters/Monster_kayna_young_bio=The warm embrace of a Kayna is a welcome surprise to any monster, and theyre quite common surprises given how kind and loving the firey monsterlings tend to be. Surprisingly, mini-eruptions from its head are actually prompted by laughter and tickling!
Monsters/Monster_fluoress_young=Young Fluoress
Monsters/Monster_fluoress_young_bio=The solemn tings of the Fluoress paralarvae make for a wonderful lullabye, so much so that they have the tendency of lulling themselves to sleep while playing! In any case, Fluoress were never known for their attention-keeping habits to begin with, as they most often spend their waking hours poking and prodding at the wide array of critters that call the Floating City their home.
Monsters/Monster_theremind_young=Young Theremind
Monsters/Monster_theremind_young_bio=Young Thereminds are such mischievous minds! With their psychic abilities, they can drag objects with their minds... very VERY often. Where there is a Little Theremind, one can expect a not-so-little mess. Toys fly apart, dishes break! And now someone's dinner was right on the head of one of the monsterlings. But besides creating a "creative" mess, brainy friends have other hobbies. They like to show the crowd different tricks with disappearances, cards and animals in a hat. Despite the mischievous nature, everyone loves the young Theremind!
Monsters/Monster_flootfly_young=Young Floot Fly
Monsters/Monster_flootfly_young_bio=Whoosh! Spry Flootlings are adventurous, soaring through the skies. Never seen without their signature masks, its said they search for something lost long ago...
Monsters/Monster_clackula_young=Young Clackula
Monsters/Monster_clackula_young_bio=While normally reserved and quiet, the hands of a Clackula tot are nothing short of a handful! The occasional snip of the sharper baby teeth of a Clackula is a frightening sensation to many, though their fellow monsterlings make sure to maintain their patience. After all, Clackulas are essentially learning table manners for 3!

#BABY DOUBLES#
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo_young=Young Dandidoo
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo_young_bio=With that delightful tuft, the unmistakable dandidoo prefers to sit in one spot, admiring the world as it goes by. Who knows whether it forgets all it sees, or if echos of a murky past remain, tucked away within the dandelion dancer. 
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_young=Young Oaktopus
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_young_bio=While they may appear to be like leaves atop a tree, the bubbles adorning an Oaktopus sapling's crown is more akin to that of deep-sea waterfoam! While far-removed from the Living Ocean amidst The Lost World, Oaktopus youngsters still find a way to stay moist, even if it means rooting around in the local Fountain of Gob.
Monsters/Monster_maw_young=Young Maw
Monsters/Monster_maw_young_bio=It should come to no surprise that the young Maw is filled to the brim of pure water! Essentially acting as fuzzy water balloons, Maw pups quickly learn to manage their fluid intake and outtake through their highly-evolved... well, maws. While being slobbered on by a wandering Maw tongue may never be a pleasant experience to bystanders, the handlers have determined it more just means said maw wants to be your friend. aww.
Monsters/Monster_quibble_young=Young Quibble
Monsters/Monster_quibble_young_bio=The endless enthusiasm of a Quibble hatchling is one unmatched by any other monster species. Collecting all sorts of colorful pebbles to make up its training keys, their creativity is bolstered by their endless asking of questions! Of course, the celestials are always glad to assist in answering all sorts of questions, though they still can't seem to discover the answer of where baby monsters come from...
<Monsters/Monster_quibble_rare>
Monsters/Monster_phangler_young=Young Phangler
Monsters/Monster_phangler_young_bio=Meet the young Phangler! As they grow, Phanglers develop microphones that enhance hearing for other monsters.
Monsters/Monster_stogg_young=Young Stogg
Monsters/Monster_stogg_young_bio=The astonishing arpeggios of the fledgling Stoggling have been a signature staple of the City's ambiance for as long as anyone can remember. And a bit further than that. Shockingly, young stoggs love to be buried in snow!
Monsters/Monster_knucklehead_young=Young Knucklehead
Monsters/Monster_knucklehead_young_bio=For a species known for their high motor function, one would perhaps be surprised to learn that Knuckleheads don’t start out with such skill! In truth, Knucklehead pebblings are more accustomed to sculpting nondescript globs with clay and playing with dolls than creating such delicately sculpted figures and props. Immature as they are, young Knuckleheads will often frustrate themselves with the finer details, and it is said that few have lived to tell the tale of the following temper tantrums…
Monsters/Monster_osstax_young=Young Osstax
Monsters/Monster_osstax_young_bio=It’s well-known that Osstax begins their lives as a few individuals who join together later in their life. This normally takes many, many years, as they need to fit together perfectly to become a full Osstax, but for the few individuals that find their perfect match early on, you get a scene like this one! Osstak Pebblets, despite being generally sedentary, can come up with all sorts of plans for all sorts of trouble. They’re easily able to plot with the other members of their stak, and use this extra doubled brainpower to be doubly unpredictable. You know what they say, two heads are always better than one!

#BABY TRIPLES#
Monsters/Monster_spunge_young=Young Spunge
Monsters/Monster_spunge_young_bio=The young spunge is a very adorable monster, having tons of friends to play with all day, everyday. Their cheeks have evolved to be very resistant to the awesome songs they play!
Monsters/Monster_reedling_young=Young Reedling
Monsters/Monster_reedling_young_bio=What is a flute but something fun to toot, young Reedlings always say. Or at least thats what its assumed they are trying to communicate, as gusty wheezes and adorable drooling arent quite in our database of translatable languages yet. Nevertheless, the canine cutie happily joins in on any activities the other youngsters have. 
Monsters/Monster_rootitoot_young=Young Rootitoot
Monsters/Monster_rootitoot_young_bio=The calm air that young Rootitoots provide are much appreciated solace in the boistrous and playful city. While supervised naps are offered, too many sleeping monsters around a local Rootitoot can cause a bit of a jam, and not the tasty kind. 
Monsters/Monster_bridgit_young=Young Bridg-it
Monsters/Monster_bridgit_young_bio=Young Bridg'its love bows, tiaras and anything that makes them look adorable, their hair is always well decorated and combed, however, they have such tiny arms, they can't do all this work by themselves! Luckily there is always a motherly Scaratar nearby who is willing to help them with their tangly issues.
Monsters/Monster_frondley_young=Young Frondley
Monsters/Monster_frondley_young_bio="Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!" Young frondleys may sound like they are thinking, but you are wrong!

#BABY QUADS#
Monsters/Monster_gloptic_young=Young Gloptic
Monsters/Monster_gloptic_young_bio=Gloptic puddlings are notoriously slippery, with their specialized mucus having been spread across almost all of their body via tumbles spurred on by juvenile clumsiness. Gloptics, being a lineage adapted to far lower gravity, take a long time to get used to mobilization after all! As a result, one may think their large, exposed eyeball would be the first subject of harm, but that's not the case! Gloptic puddlings actually posess a far thicker coating around their eyeballs, like a secondary lens that is shed as they get older. However, this lens, which often gets covered by slime itself, often merely clouds the gloptic's vision further, causing yet more slips and stumbles... It's best to use padding when crafting the ideal habitat for a young Gloptic.

#BABY SEASONALS#
Monsters/Monster_punkleton_young=Young Punkleton
Monsters/Monster_punkleton_young_bio=Boo! Young Punkletons are said to have emerged from the pumpkins that litter the Floating City, enchanted by the harvest moon. The gourdly ghouls love to creep up behind fellow monsterlings, before surprising them- with loads of tasty treats!

Monsters/Monster_yool=Yool
Monsters/Monster_yool_young=Lost Young Yool
Monsters/Monster_yool_young_bio=As the snow lay round about (deep and crispy and even) one wintry night long ago, a group of Monsters gathered around to construct the first coldman (snowman, for you human world types). They laughed and made merry, and rejoiced in the warmth of each other's company during this hibernal pastime. That wasn't the only thing that was warm, though - the frenzy and frolicking of the Monsters at play (especially the Fire Monsters) began to melt the coldman! To their utter surprise, as the powdery snow fell away, a young Monster carried by only its beard was unveiled. At first sight of the Seasonal, the Monsters felt a surge of holiday cheer and goodwill towards Monsters. And thus, the Yool was born, forever after celebrated as the keeper of joy to the Monster World.

#ADULT OFFICIAL SINGLES#
Monsters/Monster_potbelly=Potbelly
Monsters/Monster_potbelly_bio=The adult potbelly is a loud and extroverted creature, constantly babbling nonsense to everyone who can hear. Whilst other monsters would love to stay around and listen, eventually a potbelly may take off its pot and settle into the jabber, sometimes not even noticing the rooty tendrils engulfing it’s eager listener. Luckily, these days monsters have learned to stay away or gently remind the potbelly, and things go smooth from there.
Monsters/Monster_mammott=Mammott
Monsters/Monster_mammott_bio=Mammott bio
Monsters/Monster_tweedle=Tweedle
Monsters/Monster_tweedle_bio=Psst? Did you hear that? The featherbrained Tweedle probably did! This gossip gathering monster is known for its abysmal secret-keeping ability- but all the fellow monsters keep it around, for its signature calming coo.
Monsters/Monster_toejammer=Toe Jammer
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_bio=Adult Toe Jammers have a great bubbly personality and are very good swimmers when they live in the water. Also known to get invited to many parties and picnics with their fellow friend Floot-Fly, they know how to have a good time!!!
Monsters/Monster_noggin=Noggin
Monsters/Monster_noggin_bio=Seemingly carved from the earth itself, Noggins share a certain pride in being one of the eldest natural monster lineages. For as long as there’s been soil to overturn, Noggins have been tumbling about the landscapes with an ever-iconic Thump! However, with a recent influx of monsters discovered to also be created via statues, some have questioned if the rocky exterior of the Noggin is indicative of some divine creation… though that’s too philosophical of a question for a Noggin to contemplate itself. After all, as is their namesake, a Noggin’s most noteworthy trait beyond their craggy carapace is an incredibly thick skull.
Monsters/Monster_kayna=Kayna
Monsters/Monster_kayna_bio=Kayna Bio
Monsters/Monster_fluoress=Fluoress
Monsters/Monster_fluoress_bio=A fluoress may seem dim and dull, but that's just a facade. When in song with fellow monsters, Fluoress happily prods its dress of Fluorophyll, lighting up the darkness. While the reason for this strange reaction, as well as the origins of Fluorophyll, are quite a mystery, Fluoress gently reminds that one need not understand to appreciate. 
Monsters/Monster_theremind=Theremind
Monsters/Monster_theremind_bio=A theremind's rubbery brain may cause some alarm to those inexperienced in monster biology. I mean, it's out in the open for all to see! However, rest assured, a theremind's noodle is well-protected by a thick outer skin, which protects it from all sorts of tumbles and falls. It's not like they walk often anyways, it's far more efficient to simply float about!
Monsters/Monster_flootfly=Floot Fly
Monsters/Monster_flootfly_bio=The mystical Floot Fly is one of the most common monsters to stumble upon throughout the Lost Landscapes, as it's one of the friendliest monsters around! Floot-Flies love to throw tea parties in the most bizarre locations too! Invites to a tea party are always revered and accepted gleefully, as it's a great place to socialize and gossip!

Monsters/Monster_furcorn=Furcorn
Monsters/Monster_furcorn_bio=Furcorn bio
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo=Dandidoo
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo_bio=As the warm flows of the ocean carry oysters around the deeps, a gentle breeze carries Dandidoo across the monster world. Their migrations rely on airflow since nature wasn't kind enough to grant them wings. They can conduct the air through their bodies to store and burst it out in a powerful stream of tuned tones and semitones. That's why their singing resembles "doo"s and "dee"s.\nTheir plant element gave them a greenish hue and afro-styled hair reminiscent of a common dandelion.
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus=Oaktopus
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_bio=Oaktopi are packed full of wisdom to share with the world, about the world. They almost always have an answer to some of life's most burning questions; "Why is the sky blue?", "Is water wet?", and most notably, "Is mayonnaise an instrument?" (The answer is inconclusive, there is no mayonnaise monster). Sometimes they even say outlandish claims of islands once being carried by towering creatures across the monster world. Psh, yeah right. An Oaktopus can usually be seen reading a good book or swimming in a local hot spring.

Monsters/Monster_quibble=Quibble
Monsters/Monster_quibble_bio=The Quibble may seem like a graceful monster on the outside, but that's just a facade. The two heads constantly bicker, usually having polar opinions about the latest trends, or some other trivial issue. One time, the left Quibble wanted to order fries, but the right Quibble was eager to get a milkshake... chaos ensued. But in the end, they always make up with each other, like true siblings. Oh yeah, they ended up ordering fries dunked in a milkshake. A... unique consensus
Monsters/Monsters_quibble_rare_bio=We Don't Know How, But It Just Doesn't Want To Grow Up! They Usually Keep Their Baby Pebbles And Baby Beaks, And They Use Daggers For Hitting Them.

Monsters/Monster_denchuhs_bio=Mah dentures
Monsters/Monster_knucklehead=Knucklehead
Monsters/Monster_knucklehead_bio=The burly mitts of a matured Knucklehead may be intimidating, but it assures the handlers it would never use such strength for ill-intentioned activities. In fact, we find that most Knuckleheads spend their days playing Critters and Catacombs with their monster cohorts. Who would know that a creature with the name Knucklehead would be such an experienced storyteller!

Monsters/Monster_bridgit=Bridg-it
Monsters/Monster_bridgit_bio=While stereotypes say trolls are generally cruel and live in basements, Bridg-it's quite the opposite. This melodic monster is one of the kindest one'll meet, constantly hosting tea parties, bridge building competitions, and much more. Well we think so, we havent seen it really do... anything besides those two things. 
Monsters/Monster_frondley=Frondley
Monsters/Monster_frondley_bio=The Frondley is an ammmmmmmmmmazing specimen! Its gelatinous physique and toes bring to mind some similar monsters, but they have evolved separately from our lemon-colored companions. Their otherworldly and serene hums echo throughout islands, always making sure a Frondley's presence is known. Some monsters go as far as to record these hums to lure themselves to sleep. In other activities, Frondley enjoys maintaining their kelpy hairdos, while always striving to find the perfect amount of hair for their bulbous craniums.

#MARSH FANMADES#
Monsters/Monster_likho=Yap
Monsters/Monster_likho_bio=If you see a Yap, just know that you've just run into a nice chap! Yaps are small little tumbleweeds, rolling around picking up all sorts of plant life, and usually gifting some to others, even if they don't like it as much as the gifter. But not only that, when it stops, it prepares a... "wonderful" song for its comrades, which usually results in its audience screaming "MAKE IT STOP!" Don't know what that's about.
Monsters/Monster_varrow=Varrow
Monsters/Monster_varrow_bio=Known for its penchant for hunting, the melodic “Yah-ha-ha!” of the Varrow echoes throughout all corners of the Evergreen Swamp. It uses its call and prolonged noseharp to attempt to attract juvenile fwogs to its corner of the swamp, even though it might not work as often as it likes. In fact, its attempts more often scare its slippery prey away, leaving the Varrow fwogless and alone. It’s a sad thing too, since it truly just wants new customers to sample their fresh home-made sweets!
Monsters/Monster_wadee=Wadee
Monsters/Monster_wadee_bio=Deep below the murkiest of murky depths lies an underwater land lost to time. Many monsters have resided here, and in recent times, many from this region have adventured to the surface. If one takes a swim at the foggy center of the Evergreen Woods’ bog pools then you might hear the soggy "why" like sounds of a Wadee, one such explorer. While it was a beautiful fish in the deep, exposure to the surface has fundamentally changed it, causing its gills to shrink, it’s flippers to turn to hands, and it’s body to swell slightly. While seeming minor, these changes mean that the Wadee can no longer make the long underwater trek back home. The Wadee takes it kindly though, and uses its glowing pads to help guide other underwater travelers, and is a friend to many above and below the surface. Deep inside though, Wadee misses the sights of its home coral reef and the sounds of the Cancer Choir’s melodious tunes…
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan=Dulsylvan
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_bio=The carved Dulsylvan, a creature of wood and weathering, held together by its solid core, may seem a tad bit rude on first encounter. Known to never speak, and always donning a scowl, Dulsylvan’s bad mood is naught more than circumstance, as it’s mouth has long been cemented in that shape. In truth, the true monster lives in the small creatures that reside upon the only truly life-filled part of the being, it’s lofty twigs. These creatures, sometimes referred to as Sylvlings, cover and open holes on their ailing ancestors branches to allow air through, and giving the Dulsylvan a means of communication with its neighbors. Once Dulsylvan mystically changes into a pine cone, the Sylvlings will begin to grow and change rapidly, into young Dulsylvans of their own!
Monsters/Monster_choral=Choralle
Monsters/Monster_choral_bio=Huh? This seems to be an ordinary tree, but consider us fooled, as this is the shy protege of the Cancer Choir, Choralle! These small masters of natural trickery use a tree-like figure for protection, usually hiding from bigger monsters who usually mean no harm, as they just want to say hello! But being the introverted species they are, the Choralle produce a powerful slam with their disguise if someone gets too close. It may seem rude, but it's just instinct, which we can't blame them for.
Monsters/Monster_banno=Banno
Monsters/Monster_banno_bio=Banno is a vocalist of the legendary Cancer Choir, for a long time he spent his time in the deep cold depths of the ocean. Sadly though, it was far too cold for his hot water-loving body! Instead of moving into a geyser of some sort, he decided to stay close to his friends, utilizing an endlessly boiling bucket to keep comfy. Whilst his boiling red abdomen may be concerning, there’s no need to worry- Banno states that it’s just his natural color showing after the cleaning of thousands of years of sea gunk.
Monsters/Monster_stoopa=Stoopa
Monsters/Monster_stoopa_bio=Not much is known about the misty marsh deep in the heart of the Evergreen Woods, but legends speak of a strange monster that watches over and leads the song of the monsters that reside there. And whaddya know, here it is! Stoopa is even more of a recycling expert than Congle, finding anything and everything in nature to produce its song, even if it has to make some exceptions with its nature-based rule at times- proven by those... pots and pans on its stupa? Still very little is known about it, and Stoopa prefers to keep it that way while it wields its strange staff, and guards the secrets of the Marsh.

Monsters/Monster_knife=Banchi
Monsters/Monster_knife_bio=Banchi is the beloved mythical of Candy Island. For years untold, the Banchi have been making the popular glutinous rice snack that is the monster-mochi, through which they also play their unique song. A rumor says that they use a secret ingredient to make their monster-mochi make a sound on impact, but no-one really knows what it is. Some speculations suggest that a certain feline spectral figure helped them out- someone who Banchi refers to as family.

Monsters/Monster_knife_rare=Rare Banchi
Monsters/Monster_Knife_rare_bio=Wow! It appears this once-cute and cuddly monster lost its sweet tooth and gained a taste for the savoury! This sub-species of Banchi gained a darker and more luscious coat so it can hunt easier. Instead of its sweet mochi balls, the Rare Banchi plays on fried nondescript cephalopod balls! Its teeth have also adapted, becoming flatter to eat the balls easier. Unfortunately, it eats hair too.

Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof=Wubbox
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof_bio=One day as the monsters were tunneling underground, they stumbled upon an immense underground vault containing several of the mysterious objects known as the Wubbox. Very little is known of their origin or purpose, save a few observations:\n\nSample analysis of the box's exterior indicates that it shares traits with every known monster species - in fact, it even has specialized compartments with an otherworldy shrinking technology. The box is also imbued with an elemental energy unfamiliar to those on the surface - a shocking discovery, to say the least.\n\nGather some intrepid monster volunteers and see what happens when you 'box' them!
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof_awake=<ref>Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_undof_awake_bio=Eureka! The Wubbox awakes!  As it turns out, this extraordinary electric elemental is vital to the life processes of the colossal island monsters that the other singing denizens call home.  The shrunken monsters used to power up the creature report that inside is as fun as any playground they've ever seen, so they are happy to stay indefinitely.The robotic chirps and whistles it uses to express itself can take some getting used to, but eventually become a beloved and inextricable part of the island's tune.  Besides, it's all the rage in "current" music.The specific breeding characteristics of the Wubbox have not yet been studied.

Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof=Rare Wubbox
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof_bio=Unlike the common Wubbox, the Rare can be bought for a song - as long as you're singing the right tune. In this inactive state, it's hard to tell what physically differentiates the two monsters, but the most striking contrast is the Rare Wubbox's modest bed count - it's only one! We're hoping to learn more once this cryptic creature is powered up with monsters and awakens to share its song.\n\nGet going with the boxing! Your common Monsters just won't do - this picky customer only accepts Rares.
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof_awake=<ref>Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof
Monsters/Monster_wubbox_rare_undof_awake_bio=The story goes that this monster yearned to learn more about the human world, and embarked on a journey through the multiverse. It's now obvious that the Wubbox hurtled not only through space, but also time, towards its destination. Upon its return, it extolled the virtues of revolutionary music tech like turntables, keytars and vocoders. Thanks to its talent for self-customization, the Wubbox integrated pieces of its discoveries into its very being, forever altering its shape, song, and completing its transformation into the sensational Rare Wubbox.

Monsters/Monster_maulch_awake_bio=Maulch, the Monotone Mumbler, is perhaps not who you'd expect out here, but whaddaya know! Maulch's Large Lulaguleaf requires much watering, and nowhere has better rain than here it says. Of course, nobody else has even seen it rain but thats irrelevant...

Monsters/Monster_claramel_rare=Rare Claramel
Monsters/Monster_claramel_rare_bio=You may think the rare claramel is just normal claramel but with a blue and green substance on them, but, you would be WRONG! This creature is actually not a claramel at all! When a Rare Oaktopus had a failed experiment with a Clangthru, tons of goopy fluids were sent flying to Candy Island and landed on the same pipes common claramel had used for it's instrument, seeking an opportunity to be known on the new place, it had copied the same songs claramel does.

Monsters/Monster_fleechwurm_undof_awake_bio=In addition to using them to play music, some Monsters take advantage of their unique features and body shapes, and use them for other purposes. In the case of the Fleechwurm, its resonant body cavity can generate a series of whistles that have an unusual hypnotic effect on other Wublins. They can be used to coax others into doing unglamorous chores for it, or to lovingly preen its leaf-like limbs. Some Wublins are more resistant than others, and playfully admonish the Fleechwurm so it doesn't become too mischievous.


Monsters/Monster_spurrit=Spurrit
Monsters/Monster_spurrit_bio=Huzzah? HUZZAH! This intreped explorer, now farther from home than ever, is happy to explore this strange and vibrant world.

Monsters/Monster_spurrit_desert_bio=Huzzah? Huz-AAAAGH! This intreped explorer, fascinated by these ancient ruins, seems to have found some trouble with local avian life. While the Vullturs are harmless, Spurrit still freezes up at the sound of their shriek, not even letting out a characteristic yelp.


Monsters/Monster_toejammer_rare=Rare Toe Jammer
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_rare_bio=While the common Toe Jammer is a well known partygoer, this rare variant is far more accustomed to stay at home experiences, especially of the snacking kind. With some handy snackholding pegs included, there's no adventure the Rare Toe Jammer can't handle- from the comfort of a couch that is.


Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_rare=Rare Oaktopus
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_rare_bio=Sporting a pair of handy appendages, Rare Oaktopus has taken up a long time dream of being a Chemist! This wooden wizard travels the realm searching for new ingredients, from the blood of a slumbering giant to the sap of a sugary paradise. Most recently, the Rare Oaktopus has discovered that if mixed in proper proportion to other ingridients, the water of a distant marsh had hallucinogenic effects when sipped; Fascinating! 




Monsters/Monster_spunge_rare=Rare Spunge
Monsters/Monster_spunge_rare_bio=The dry-eyed Rare Spunge is a fascinating example of the adaptations that environment based mutations can bring about. Seeming to stem from particularly composed waters, mutations through this wacky spunge have changed almost everything about this Spunge, from its color to the amount of each organ it has. Some even suspect it may have a second mouth inside of its body. Ew. Just Ew. 

Monsters/Monster_percFrog=Amphibeat

Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_rare=Rare Dulsylvan
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_rare_bio=During the late stages of a Dulsylvan’s time, it’s body begins to rapidly change. Old, solid wood morphs into a light airy shape, known as a sylvcone. The Dulsylvan’s body begins to ooze a sweet sap, that will feed its young Sylvlings after it has passed on, and it’s nose changes to a luscious green shade. While these latter days are considered to be short, they are known to be filled with joy, as the old Dulsylvan becomes able to move freely once more! Eventually though, it slows down, and the sap crystallizes the sylvcone and preserves it for eternity…


Monsters/Monster_varrow_rare=Rare Varrow
Monsters/Monster_varrow_rare_bio=What do you find when you place a needle inside a nutshell, inside a berry, in a cloth, place it in a chest, and bury it at the bottom of the marsh's waters? A Rare Varrow, that's what! These queer monsters have a penchance to anything puzzling and paradoxical- including themselves! While it's unknown how these odd monsters came into existence, they're here to stay, boasting their garments and trinkets from distant lands and giving everyone something to ponder every chance they get...

Monsters/Monster_banno_rare=Rare Banno
Monsters/Monster_banno_rare_bio=With it's beautiful bowlcut and it's long, luscious beard, this monster always knows how to chant and sing your heartstrings into a knot. No matter what it's doing, this monster is always seen in a barrel filled up with lots of warm water, perfect for it's skin!




Monsters/Special/Monster_melochness=Meloch-Ness
Monsters/Special/Monster_melochness_bio=Born from the Enchanted Ponds in the Deep Woods, Meloch-Nesses are curious colossal creatures. Like most of the Faerie Forests' inhabitants, this monster's existence is tied heavily to the Flora Fog. While we still don’t know exactly what it does, the Fog seems to amplify Meloch-Ness’s to melodic tunes and carry far and wide. Its enchanting melody can be heard from a whole forest away when it's is carried by the Flora Fog. In fact, it was the first thing the natural monsters heard when they arrived in the Deep Woods. Meloch-Ness is also said to share a common ancestor with Reedling and Blabbit. What. How you get dis. Excuse me. Magical Expansion is not canon. L + Ratio. TLL is not as good as Dawn of Fire. - Mr. Magic of Expanding

Monsters/Knott_1=Knottshurr Tree
Monsters/Knott_1_bio=This creature, despite not looking sylvan, is an ent. It's the next point in evolution of the Surr trees, conifers found across the island. Its bark is almost pertified and impenetrable by most of the vermins and predators. Yet a particular species of "Plantcarver nymph" have developed strong teeth that can gnaw away the stone bark and settle inside of the everblue. The tree's bark is extremely resonant from the inside. Allowing nymths to sing while inside and resonate a deep-throated, ear-piercing sound. The holes carved away by the nymphs resemble a face to scare away unwanted guests and attend on the yearly spooktackle decoration contest.

As for why these Souxls are so restless? Nobody knows...
Monsters/Knott_4=BoOoo
Monsters/Knott_4_bio=All those who hail from the Thumpiverse are well versed in the practice of interdimensional leaps, and BoOoo is no exception. Fleeing the abysmal depths of its former home, BoOoo embarked on a long and widespread journey for a new home. Eventually, it found a strange mountain, deep below the Silver Crags, that emitted a strange feeling that resonated with BoOoo. At first staying to investigate, the cryptic aura of the region has convinced BoOoo to finally choose a true home for the first time in millennia. However, no gift comes without its price, and without careful consumption of local materials, the region’s alien magic might take hold on BoOoo and the other residents in strange ways… 
Monsters/Knott_5=Mount Tuzzpikk
Monsters/Knott_5_bio=Mount Tuzzpikk was a regular Knott-rock that got affected by the Knottsurr magic, emmited from the mystical orbs found across the Knottsurr Island. It gained musical abilities and immediately after being animated, started to sing. It knows many compositions but "Pearrdesh Slougna" and "Ellepharrth" by "DJ. Goldenduck" is the closest to its rock heart. You can find it humming the melody non-stop whenever it's not singing.\nLeaving the island would result in reverting to its initial state of non-sentience. Unless it carries one of the sources of Knottsurr magic with it wherever it goes.

Monsters/Knott_7=Flocca
Monsters/Knott_7_bio="Flocca! Flocca!"\nCan be heard whenever this monster is around. Floccas are cratures made of pure bone, held together by magic and plucktape. The skull of this cheerful maracc-oss player somehow grew furr and functioning ears and eyes. Giving the sense of sight and sound. Adding to that the sense of Oss-ception is present. Sense that gives an ability to feel the presense of other bones from far far away and easily identifying types of bones and skeletons. Also Oss-ception helps to identify any types of bone injuries, helping monsters around in case of an accident.

It uses its knitting skills to keep their adopted grandchildren in warmth and welfare and usually never leaves their sight. Most of the representatives of the species are several millenia old, and seem to never visually change after hitting a milestone of 80 years.\nDespite all of that, there are specimens that had a tragic past and never recovered since. Those exemplars tend to be more aggressive towards everyone around.

Monsters/Knott_1_rare=Rare Knottshurr Tree
Monsters/Knott_1_rare_bio=Thanks to the greening stalk-like body of Rare Knottshurr Tree, provided by one of the BoOoos, it developed an anti-nymph odor, keeping them safe from those nasty plantcarvers. However, the newly developed smell just so happened to be chemically similar to the flitterfly pheromones. Thus, attracting even peskier pests. Long story short, it's now a flitterfly nest.

Monsters/Knott_4_rare=Rare BoOoo
Monsters/Knott_4_rare_bio=Rare BooOo is a misleading name. These thumpies are actually Ghawgs. Fishy looking, yet still very much covered in fur, creatures. Always accompanied by a pack of tortappers seeking new life and exciting adventures, they travel between realms and explore the world. Occasionally stoping for a few months if they like the place. These monsters sure know how to enjoy life.
Monsters/Knott_5_rare=Rare Mount Tuzzpikk
Monsters/Knott_5_rare_bio=Unlike mount Tuzzpikks that we are used to, these particular variants have a plethora of unique facial features on each of their heads.

Monsters/Monster_whimstlop_bio=The inner machinations of the Whimstlop are an enigma. What's seen on the outside of this passive monster is merely a suit of armor, with its "helmet" portion enlarged by the wielding of discarded armor from its youth. Its organic aspects lie beneath its metallic sheathing, with the only visible parts being a singular eye (it lost the other one) and two twig-like legs (surprisingly strong given the burden of lifting its armor). Depending on its environment, a Whimstlop can don an armor of a different material to fit its current needs. Sometimes they work as part-time leafblowers, expelling much of the dirt and grime its other monster pals bring in.

When not questioning it's own existence, this monster mystery's passions include knitting neck socks, stumbling over just about anything, and passionately playing it's clumsy heart out on its lyrologs.

Structures/Structure_breeding_undof_bio=This peculiar structure has been in use since the golden age of the Monster World, and little has changed since that time. Once it is old enough, a Monster can spontaneously produce an egg containing all of its genetic and elemental information, which is then placed onto one of the 'bowls' of the machine. These eggs, which are truly more like spores, slowly seep out their 'precious bodily fluids' down the twin drains of the structure and magically co-mingle in the center vessel, until a new egg is produced! The process is complicated though, as one breeding combination can have many possible outcomes.

While the knowledge to create more was lost long ago, many can be found lying around in buildings across the floating city. These strange machines are known to be far more intelligent than any other being within the known realm, but yet cannot communicate with the outside world, leaving them to hum and strum bass notes hoping to be understood…

Monsters/Monster_kayna_undof=<ref>Monsters/Monster_kayna
Monsters/Monster_kayna_undof_bio=The ancient Kayna was long thought lost to an enigmatic event in monster antiquity. A solitary specimen encased in amber was rescued on Tribal Island. It's true, but only recently did a new generation of these beings begin to appear, beckoned by the mysterious call of Relics resonating deep within the world's volcanic core. Now this feisty Fire Elemental is ready to play its part in restoring the glory of its powerful Element in the Monster World.

Monsters/Monster_kayna_rare_undof=Rare Kayna
Monsters/Monster_kayna_rare_undof_bio=Bearers of the oldest Element of all, Rare Kaynas are an ancient breed from which all their Common cousins have sprung.

Yet no matter how old the original Fire Rare gets, the burning glow of the Fire Element never dims.

Monsters/Monster_noggin_undof=<ref>Monsters/Monster_noggin
Monsters/Monster_noggin_undof_bio=Noggins are basically musical rocks. Deeply in tune with the Earth, their simple rhythms echo an Island’s pulse. The sensation of reverberation produced by a Noggin motivates all other monsters.

Monsters/Monster_noggin_rare_undof=Rare Noggin
Monsters/Monster_noggin_rare_undof_bio=After scouring the World for what felt like forever, the Rare Noggin has been unearthed. Not satisfied with a simple existence as a musical rock, this capricious creature reinvented itself as the building block of an exotic edifice. Because of their limited maneuverability, it's unclear whether a group of Rare Noggins could ever actually cooperate to build anything... perhaps a more down-to-Earth goal would be to just keep the rhythm for its fellow monsters.

Monsters/Monster_fwog_undof=Fwog
Monsters/Monster_fwog_undof_bio=Emerging from its muddy birthplace, the Fwog sings passionately in the hope of attracting a companion. Its hypnotic call fills the air, stirring the most primal feelings of excitement in all Monsters.

Monsters/Monster_thrumble_undof=Thrumble
Monsters/Monster_thrumble_undof_bio=Wide-mouthed and keen snackers, Thrumbles are prone to swallowing treats whole.

When thrumming on an empty stomach, bubbling pockets of air can expand and prompt a sudden flurry of giggles!
Monsters/Monster_thrumble_rare_undof=Rare Thrumble

Monsters/Monster_stogg_undof_bio=As avid rock collectors, Stoggs relish digging into the earth with their powerful forelegs to find shiny new minerals. Unfortunately, this absentminded monster also enjoys burying their treasure, often forgetting the location soon after.

Monsters/Monster_gumtromp=Gumtromp
Monsters/Monster_gumtromp_bio=A sweet demeanored treat, the adorable Gumtromp parades around the monster world, giving inspirational speeches on how... candy is actually good for you and how the toothbrush mafia is out to get everyone.

Monsters/Monster_keytrus=Keytrus
Monsters/Monster_keytrus_bio=Like its surprisingly-close kin, the Koodahcane, Keytrus is far-disconnected from its fellow candy monsters via its complete inedibility! In fact, Keytrus often find themselves scavenging about the surface of the Konficshonn colossal for sour sweets and delicacies! This sweet -- or, rather, sour -- tooth is only satiated by the disc-shaped fruits found growing in the colossal's beard. It then uses specialized claws at the tips of its limbs, normally covered by leaflike feathers, to slice the orange in half, revealing 4 quadrants of flesh that can be tapped to produce a wonderfully whimsical tink! These fruits, called Discus Fruits by the other monsters, are actually not sour at all, but Keytrus doesn't know that... don't ruin its fun.

Monsters/Monster_keytrus_rare=Rare Keytrus
Monsters/Monster_keytrus_rare_bio=In the sugary haven of Candy Island resides Rare Keytrus. This delectable creature perches on a pepperoni pizza pad, navigating a world where its unique blend of sweetness and spiciness makes it a sought-after target for candy-crazed monsters. Despite its adorable appearance, Rare Keytrus is a master of evasion, outsmarting and outmaneuvering those who crave a taste of Rare Keytrus.

Monsters/Monster_koodahcane=Koodahcane
Monsters/Monster_koodahcane_bio=The sweetening antlers of the Koodahcane are beloved by all inhabitants of the Candy Island. All sugar in the bloodstream of these scaly fish are accumulated on the tip of their skull and grown like hair. When it reaches a tipping point, Once a month or so, these sucrose-filled cranial canes are shed and left to be collected around the island, as sweet treats. 

Monsters/Monster_koodahcane_rare=Rare Koodahcane
Monsters/Monster_koodahcane_rare_bio=Just like the Rare Sprinklate, Koodahcane wanted to be special also. Thats why when a Rare Sprinklate was giving a speech on a Chocolate Podium, Koodahcane came and smushed it's face into it, giving them the chocolate limbs, and when every monster was scrambling not knowing what to do, the Koodahcane sprayed on some cotton candy foam onto their body also, and just when you thought it was over, they went to the edge of the island and picked sme seawoed up and stuck it on their horns!

Monsters/Monster_marshflamo=Marshflamo
Monsters/Monster_marshflamo_bio=Marshflamos are known to be some of the most warm hearted monsters out there- quite literally, given their molten gooey marshmallowey cores! As time goes on, Marshflamos age through their rapid life cycle, their internal heat toasting them to perfection, before they harden and set ablaze. Their crumbling black shell falls off and reveals a shining new exterior, pure and light as a cloud. As residents of the newly formed sugary refuge in the Pocket Dimension, from the disaster that destroyed the Monster World, Marshflamos work to keep their fellow monsters safe, while telling spooky stories around an ever toasty campfire.

Monsters/Monster_marshflamo_rare=Rare Marshflamo
Monsters/Monster_marshflamo_rare_bio_old=One day, while a common Marshflamo was wondering throughout Candy island, a mischevious stogg was up to no good, while Marshflamo was wondering around, without a care in the world, BOOM! Stogg had pushed Marshflamo into a pit that was just lit for a nice campfire, all the monsters screamed as Marshflamo came out, burnt, but marshmallows don't have pain, so they didn't really care at all..

Monsters/Monster_marshflamo_rare_bio=Wow! This monster's beats are fire! Literally! Rare Marshflamo drop beats so hard, their inner cores begin spontaneously combusting, and they start getting crispy! Other monsters love the smell of a playing Rare Marshflamo.

Monsters/Monster_brasscuit=Brasscuit
Monsters/Monster_brasscuit_bio=The legend says that a while ago a common ancestor of the Brasscuit and the Stogg got stranded on Candy Island. Initially the new environment was too harsh for the newcomers, but their hard working nature let them adapt and overcome the new challenges, and slowly the species formed into the Brasscuit we know today! Their acoustic horns are self-made, and sewn from the toughest licorice that can be found on the island. Brasscuits are expert foragers, and can smell a good snack from across the island. 

Monsters/Monster_brasscuit_rare=Rare Brasscuit
Monsters/Monster_brasscuit_rare_bio=Polka Dots? What has the Brasscuit been doing?

Monsters/Monster_gobstomper=Gobstomper
Monsters/Monster_gobstomper_bio=It's said that Gobstompers are the toughest of candy monsters. Their layered shells can withstand the highest of falls and the heaviest of punches without a single chip. Despite all that, the Gobstompers' personalities reflect their chewy, gummy interiors. They are always ready to help out around Candy Island, and wherever else they may roam. Still, from time to time they may yet find themselves eager for some friendly competition for who has the sturdiest crust with their hard-headed friends.

Monsters/Monster_claramel=Claramel
Monsters/Monster_claramel_bio=The ever-shimmering Claramel is known for its caramelized form and playful tunes. But it wasn't always that way, and at one point it was in a liquid state, scathing and sticky. But an encounter with a Reedling inspired Claramel! It attached DIY cinnamon pipes to its tail and practiced tirelessly. Eventually the winds passing through froze its body in a crystalline dynamic splash that made it all the more memorable and beloved.

Monsters/Monster_sprinklate=Sprinklate
Monsters/Monster_sprinklate_bio=As the tasty team leader of Candy Island, almost everyone has heard of Sprinklate at some point or another.

Monsters/Monster_ghazt_undof=Ghazt
Monsters/Monster_ghazt_undof_bio=The extraordinary Ghazt only manifests itself when conditions are absolutely perfect. Imbued with the Ethereal power of Plasma, its sleek frame and ability to become intangible are ideal for slipping in and out of places unnoticed. However, these traits also make it vulnerable to accidental interdimensional travel. It plays well with the other Monsters, but just like a cat, it sometimes prefers to be alone... or in the company of others of its kind.

Decoration/Decoration_test9=Spare Parts

Decoration/Decoration_test10=Baloony
Decoration/Decoration_test10_bio=They call him friend substitute. Lonely monsters come to Baloony at any time and share their stories with him. Our "friend" used to fly around freely, exploring the monster world, but he got stuck between two rocks with nothing left to do but to sway serenely from side to side. Nobody knows who created Baloony, but rumors say that it slightly resembles its creation. Who knows, maybe we will meet one day.
Decoration/Decoration_test11=Blood Blossom Tree
Decoration/Decoration_test11_bio=Okay... I've seen a lot of disgusting things from the Terra of Organs but this takes the cake! Like what on Galvana's Monster World is that!? It's just- HMMPH! I gotta go to the bathroom... I think I'm gonna throw up...

Monsters/Monster_olga=Olgaropipe
Monsters/Monster_olga_bio=Sent into the chronic void, Hyddryd's aquatic element overwhelmed all matter and reformed monsters into new identites, creating new monsters like the kind and soft Olgaropipe. Transformed, they now shimmered with luminescence, gaining the ability to manipulate water. United, they became protectors of the void, their movements echoing cosmic tides. Through liquid currents, they coordinate a mesmerizing symphony, bringing newfound equilibrium to the Gamma Water Island and the ruins of the Monster World.
Monsters/Monster_olga_rare=Rare Olgaropipe (Doesn't have a file yet)
Monsters/Monster_olga_rare_bio=A solitary and melancholic creature, the elusive rare olgaropipe resides in the concealed depths of Gamma Water Island. Despite efforts to connect with this enigmatic yellow being, every outreach has proven futile. Many monsters, deeming the rare olgaropipe an anomaly, ultimately choose to keep their distance, perceiving it as an outcast in their eyes.
Monsters/Monster_potbellyGM=Kelpebbul
Monsters/Monster_potbellyGM_bio=After the strange events that led to the ruins of the monster world being transferred to a realm outside of space and time, the islands we know and love were turned into Gamma Islands, their inhabitants reborn into spectacular new forms. One such example is the Kelpebbul, the reformed plant elemental, who dazzles with a dreamy demeanor and charms with the sweetest of smiles. These stone monsters have the power to imbue lifeforce into any plant, rejuvinating flora of all sorts and giving them means to vocalize. These sprouts tend to have strange and unique voices, a result of discovering their singing abilities the first time. 
Monsters/Monster_quibbleGM=Jastanaw
Monsters/Monster_quibbleGM_bio=Well... it seems that it's in a Quibble's DNA to denature into a strange creature whenever it's modified. Alike to monsters long since extinct such as the Epic and Prismatic Quibbles, it seems something in this monsters elemental core caused it to turn into... this. Worry not, because it doesn't seem like too painful of a condition, and it still loves to sing- or is that a scream? It's not a scream. We think. 

Monsters/Monster_quibblegm_rare=Rare Jastanaw
Monsters/Monster_quibblegm_rare_bio=Once apon a time, in a land far in time, a Jastanaw was peacefully enjoying their stay at Gamma Water Island, but suddenly, and without warning, AH! A Paint Bucket landed on Jastanaw, causing it to change colors and dent one of their horns. They seemed confused but a ‎Kelpebbul came and got the nasty bucket off of Jastanaw.
